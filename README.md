# trajectory_distance
=====================

**trajectory_distance** is a Python module for computing distance between trajectory objects.
It is implemented in both Python and Cython.

## Description

**trajectory_distance** contains 9 distances between trajectory.

1. SSPD (Symmetric Segment-Path Distance)
2. OWD  (One-Way Distance)
3. Hausdorff
4. Frechet
5. Discret Frechet
6. DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)
7. LCSS (Longuest Common Subsequence)
8. ERP (Edit distance with Real Penalty)
9. EDR (Edit Distance on Real sequence)

## Dependencies

trajectory_distance is tested to work under Python 2.7.

The required dependencies to build the software are NumPy >= 1.9.1, Cython >= 0.21.2, shapely >= 1.5.6, Geohash and a working C/C++ compiler.

## Install

This package uses distutils. To install in your home directory, use:

```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

## How to use it

You only need to import the distance module.

```
import traj_dist.distance as tdist
```

All distances are in this module. There is also two extra function 'cdist', and 'pdist' to compute distances between all trajectories in a list.

Trajectory should be represented as 2-Dimensions numpy array.
See traj_dist/example.py file.

Some distance requires extra-parameters.
See the help function for more information about how to use each distance.
